3. Contributor Guidelines:
 - Clearly outline the steps for contributing recipes:
 - Fork the main repository to a contributor's GitHub account.
 - Create a new branch for the recipe (e.g., "recipe/chocolate-chip-cookies").
 - Write the recipe in a Markdown file.
 - Optionally, add relevant images to the recipe folder.
 - Submit a pull request to the main repository for review and inclusion.
You can include these guidelines in the README file, or create a separate CONTRIBUTING.md file.
4. Recipe Submission:

Encourage users to submit recipes following the contributor guidelines.

Review submitted pull requests to ensure recipe quality and adherence to guidelines.

Merge accepted recipes into the main repository.

5. Version Control and Collaboration:

Use Git features (branches, pull requests, commits) to manage changes and track the history of each recipe.

Encourage collaboration by allowing users to suggest improvements to existing recipes through pull requests.
